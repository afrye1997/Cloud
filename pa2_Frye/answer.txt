Bigrams are two consective words combined into one string separated by a space.
To piece together a bigram, I set a variable called previous word to null then checked
how many words were in value. If there was only 1, it skipped. Next, I set the current word
to the iterated word and said if the previous word was not null, then combine previous word 
and current word, else set the previous word to the current word. In the if statement, it wrote
to context, the bigram and one. If it wrote to context outside of the if statement, there would be 
repeated bigrams. 

To count the number of map tasks, I called the cleanup function. This function is called at the end
of every map task. It wrote to context. The number of map taks was 3.
